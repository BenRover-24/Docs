Waiting for the integration of ROS (Robot Operating System) and the implementation of the Rover management software, which will be installed on the Rover control station server, we used the Flysky FS-i6 remote control and its Flysky FS receiver -iA6 to set up the code logic and carry out the various tests (motor tests, servo-motor tests, etc.). Later, after the integration of ROS, the Flysky FS-i6 remote control and its Flysky FS-iA6 receiver will be replaced by the Xbox controller, which will be connected to the management software to allow remote control of the Rover via WI-FI.

## How Does the Rover Handle Turns? üîÑ
### Ackermann Steering Geometry ‚öôÔ∏è

The four steerable wheels (the two front and rear wheels) have individual steering mechanisms equipped with REV-41-1097 servo motors from REV ROBOTICS. To enhance the rover's maneuverability during turns, we applied Ackermann steering geometry to the steerable wheels. Ackermann steering geometry, widely used in the steering principles of many cars, allows the wheels to turn at different angles, optimizing turning performance and reducing tire wear.

Ackermann steering geometry suggests that during a turn, the inner wheels have a larger steering angle than the outer wheels. Thus, the outer wheels describe a larger arc than the inner wheels.

## Servo motors interfacing with Arduino mega board through TIP122 transistors

The wheels at the corners of the Benrover are equiped with four Rev Smart Robotic Servos

![rev-41-1097](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mahudjro369/MyBenrover2024/main/docs/electronics/images/materials/rev-41-1097.jpg) 

Those servo motors that we are using as specified by the constructor in the electrical specifications's table on the following page [Smart Robot Servo Specifications](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-crossover-products/servo/srs), have a stall current of 2 A at 6V. 
This means that each one can take 2 A current at maximum load from the supply source. They need a PWM pulse range from 500 ¬µs to 2500 ¬µs from a microcontroller to be driven.
As the Arduino mega board is only able to source 20 mA of current on his pins as notified in the datasheet of the Atmega2560‚Äôs screenshot below to produce the PWM signal.This current is enough to drive one servo, but as we are using four of then and due to some electrical constraints of the Atmega2560 itself, we need to amplify it.

![Datasheet ATmega 2560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mahudjro369/MyBenrover2024/main/docs/electronics/images/other/Datasheet%20ATmega%202560%20.jpg)

We want to ensure that all the servo-motors work correctly at the same time on the Arduino mega board to make the rover wheels turn into any desired direction.  

To hit our target we decide to make an interfacing circuit between the signal pin of the servo-motors and the Atmega2560's PWM pins. The circuit we‚Äôve chosen use a TIP122 transistors to amplify the 20 mA current from the Arduino Mega pin.  

The TIP 122 is a Darlington transistor able to amplify by 1000 the current received at his base with a collector current of 0.5 A at 3 V as mentioned in a table of the datasheet where below. Note that the current limit is of 5 A.

![Datasheet TIP122](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mahudjro369/MyBenrover2024/main/docs/electronics/images/other/Datasheet%20TIP122.jpg)

Additionally, the TIP122 can switch signal at a maximum frequency of 1 MHz. This is enough to transmit while amplifying the PWM pulses from the Arduino Mega board to the servo-motors. Where is the schematic realized on each signal pin.
