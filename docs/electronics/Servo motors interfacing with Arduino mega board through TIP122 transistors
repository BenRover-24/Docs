The wheels at the corners of the Benrover are equiped with four Rev Smart Robotic Servo ![rev-41-1097](https://github.com/BenRover-24/docs/blob/main/docs/electronics/images/materials/rev-41-1097.jpgservo-motors) that we are using have a stall current of 2 A at 6V which means that it can take 2 A current at maximum load from its supply source and need a PWM pulse range from 500 µs to 2500 µs from a microcontroller to be driven.
As the Arduino mega board is only able to source 20 mA of current on his pins as notified in the datasheet of the Atmega2560’s screenshot below.
