The wheels at the corners of the Benrover are equiped with four Rev Smart Robotic Servo ![rev-41-1097](https://github.com/Mahudjro369/MyBenrover2024/blob/main/docs/electronics/images/materials/rev-41-1097.jpg) 
Those servo motors that we are using as specified by the constructor in the table below have a stall current of 2 A at 6V. 
This means that each one can take 2 A current at maximum load from its supply source and need a PWM pulse range from 500 µs to 2500 µs from a microcontroller to be driven.
As the Arduino mega board is only able to source 20 mA of current on his pins as notified in the datasheet of the Atmega2560’s screenshot below.
