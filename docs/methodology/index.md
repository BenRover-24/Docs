# Project Methodologies

Our team, BenRover, employs a structured approach to project management to ensure effective collaboration and timely delivery of our Mars Rover project. Here's an overview of our key methodologies

## Team Structure

We have organized our team into five specialized groups, each focusing on critical aspects of the rover development:

1. Mechanical Engineering Team (5 members)
2. Electrical Engineering Team (5 members)
3. IT Team (5 members)
4. Space Science Team (3 members)
5. Operations/Project Management Team (5 members)

Team members represent various universities within Benin and abroad, as well as the Sémè City Open Park.

## Regular Meetings

- Weekly general body meetings every Thursday
- Allocated Sundays for concentrated work and cross-team collaboration

## Project Management Tools

- Trello for task management
- Gantt chart for project timeline visualization
- Detailed task sheets with specific information

## Project Plan

We maintain a comprehensive project plan detailing:

- Tasks
- Deadlines
- Dependencies
- Responsibilities

Our Gantt chart provides an overarching view of the project, showing:

- Duration of key tasks
- Scheduled start times

## Resources

We utilize various resources for rover development:

1. **Facilities**: Sèmè City Open Park (Makerspace, Audiovisual Studio, Research Laboratory)
2. **Equipment**: 
   - CNC machines
   - Soldering station
   - Multimeters and oscilloscopes
   - Various sensors
   - CAD/CAM workshop
   - Laser cutter engraver
   - 3D printers
3. **Tools**: Screwdrivers, calipers, hammers, mallets, heat guns, pliers, jumpers
4. **Materials**: 
   - 3D printing filament
   - Plywood for laser cutting
   - Electronic components (resistors, capacitors, diodes, sensors, actuators)
   - Copper clad board for PCB fabrication

## Support

- Graduate students
- Staff members at the Sémè City Open Park

## Lessons Learned & Adaptations

1. **Parts Procurement**: 
   - Challenge: Difficulty finding specific parts locally
   - Solution: Searching in neighboring countries, considering design updates

2. **Software Learning Curve**: 
   - Challenge: Limited ROS2 resources
   - Solutions: 
     - Using Docker containers for consistent development environments
     - Investing in specialized ROS2 training
     - Referring to available documentation and existing projects
     - Encouraging iterative development

3. **Team Coordination**: 
   - Challenge: Organizing regular meetings with a diverse team
   - Solutions:
     - Established structured schedule accommodating different team members
     - Implemented focused approach to discussions
     - Created centralized repository for documenting insights and solutions

4. **Power Management**: 
   - Challenge: Insufficient power supply and overheating
   - Solution: Proper sizing of power supply based on component requirements

5. **Wiring and Connections**: 
   - Challenge: Signal interference
   - Solution: Special routing for wires to avoid interference

6. **Motor Control**: 
   - Challenge: Selecting appropriate motor drivers
   - Solution: Extensive testing of different drivers

7. **Camera Setup**: 
   - Challenge: Initial difficulty in receiving images
   - Solution: Persistent research and testing

By implementing these methodologies and learning from our experiences, we aim to overcome challenges and deliver a successful Mars Rover for the African Rover Challenge.
