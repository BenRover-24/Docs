## Power Management System

For efficient power system management, we have opted for the following configuration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Battery Configuration"
    icon="battery-full"
    href="#"
  >
    The rover's power supply consists of two parallel-connected 12-volt batteries, each rated at 5 Ah.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Power Monitoring"
    icon="microchip"
    href="#"
  >
    An Arduino Nano manages the power supply, displaying the temperature via an LM35 sensor and battery charge level on an I2C LCD screen.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Emergency Stop"
    icon="power-off"
    href="#"
  >
    An emergency stop button is integrated to shut down the entire system if necessary.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Autonomy"
    icon="clock"
    href="#"
  >
    With the current power supply, we have a capacity of 10 Ah, offering a maximum autonomy of 5 hours at a consumption of 2A.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Factors:
The autonomy may be reduced by factors such as variations in component consumption, circuit losses, and temperature fluctuations.

## Command System

To control the actuators such as the 5 servo motors, 6 continuous motors, and stepper motors, we used an Arduino Mega.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Servo Motors"
    icon="gears"
    href="#"
  >
    The servomotors from REV ROBOTICS are supplied with 12V and require a maximum dropout current of 2A. TIP122 transistors amplify the 20 mA supplied by the Arduino Mega.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Noise Reduction"
    icon="wave"
    href="#"
  >
    Capacitors are added to filter the noise produced by motors powered through their drivers by 12V.
  </Card>
