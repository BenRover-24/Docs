## Configuring the Raspberry Pi with the USB camera
* Install the motion package with the command : sudo apt-get install motion
* Execute the command:  sudo service motion status
* In the event of an error saying that the Motion folders located at /var/lib/ and /var/log/motion are not found, you must create the folders with the commands sudo mkdir /var/log/motion and sudo mkdir /var/lib/motion
* Check if folders have been created by moving to their location or typing : ls -ld /var/log/motion and ls -ld /var/lib/motion
* Then give permissions : sudo chmod -R 777 /var/log/motion and sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/motion
* Execute command :  sudo service motion status
* If we have an access denied error, we rerun : sudo chmod -R 777 /var/log/motion and sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/motion
* Run the command again : sudo service motion status
* this time we are supposed to have no more errors
* Run the command : sudo cp /etc/motion/motion.conf /etc/motion/motion.conf.bckp sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf to make a copy of the motion package configuration file
* Run sudo service motion start then sudo service motion status to check if the motion service is activated
* If enabled, run the command sudo nano ~/.motion/motion.log and modify the following parameters:
  *  webcontrol_port : 8080
  *  webcontrol_localhost: on
  *  stream_port : 8081
  *  stream_localhost : off
  *  output_movie :on
  *  stream_quality : 100
  *  Width : 1280
  *  Height : 720
