## Technical Requirements
Several constraints were imposed on us during the design of the rover.

### Size and Weight Limitations

| Specification | Value |
|:---------------:|:-------:|
| Maximum width | 80 cm |
| Maximum height (without antenna) | 80 cm |
| Maximum height (including antenna) | 250 cm |
| Maximum weight | 40 kg (excluding equipment in the remote control cabin) |


### Rover Specifications

- The rover must be remotely controlled by one or more human operators from the team.
- The rover must be equipped with onboard cameras to transmit live video to the control station.
- Energy autonomy is imperative; the rover must not be connected to a power cable, and the use of a combustion engine is prohibited.
- The rover must be able to cover a distance of up to 100 m from the control station.

## Materials

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Chassis">
    Made from 20x20mm square aluminum bars. Joints made of PolyLactic Acid (PLA), a biodegradable plastic material used in 3D printing, form the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped to join the aluminum bars.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suspension">
    Designed using 20mm diameter aluminum tubes and PLA parts to join the tubes into functional groups.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wheels">
    Made in two parts. The part in contact with the ground is made of ThermoPlastic Urethane (TPU), a flexible plastic material that allows the wheel to deform when in contact with obstacles like stones to minimize shock effects.

## Tools

Our mechanical team used several tools to design our rover:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SolidWorks" icon="desktop">
    A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software widely used in the mechanical engineering community due to its simple interface and range of tools from part design and assembly to simulation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3D Printer" icon="print">
    We use Creality Ender 3 Pro printers that use the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. The filaments used are either PLA+ or TPU.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Column Drill" icon="drill">
    Used for precise drilling operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hand Drill" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    For more flexible drilling needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hand Saw" icon="saw">
    Needed to cut steel bolts and aluminum tubes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standard Parts" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Screws, bolts, nuts, bearings, etc.
