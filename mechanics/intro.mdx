## Our Role

<Callout type="info">
  As the Mechanical team, our role was to design the rover's structure from a mechanical perspective, based on a pre-existing concept.
</Callout>

Our work encompassed several crucial aspects:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Suspension System" icon="shock-absorber">
    Design of a suspension system adapted to the rover's needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Power Transmission" icon="cogs">
    Development of a transmission system to perform tasks and meet necessary specifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Motor System Selection" icon="engine">
    Choice based on numerical simulations of motion analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Static Simulations" icon="calculator">
    Verification of the resistance of most critical parts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Project Scope

<Accordion title="Rover Objectives" open>
  - The rover is not intended to make a journey to Mars.
  - It is not designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the red planet.
  - It is a robot with a well-defined size.
  - It is remote-controlled and energy-independent.
  - Capable of overcoming a series of defined obstacles.
  - Can transport an object of defined physical dimensions.
